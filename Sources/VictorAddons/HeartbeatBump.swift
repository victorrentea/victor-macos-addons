/// The effect used to scale the whole captured screen 1.0 → 1.30 around the
/// cursor. That put the biggest displacement exactly where the eye is *not*
/// looking: a corner 1500 pt away from the pivot swept ~450 pt on every thump,
/// so the periphery lurched while the thing under the pointer barely moved.
/// Two beats of that reads as vertigo rather than as a pulse.
///
/// So the zoom is gone and a `CIBumpDistortion` took its place: a convex lens
/// that magnifies a disc under the cursor and is **exactly identity outside its
/// radius** — the periphery is not merely moved less, it is not moved at all.
/// What is left of the old zoom is a `breatheScale` hair of whole-screen
/// motion, pivoted at the centre so it stays symmetric.
///
/// Same bargain as `HeartbeatDogFollow` and `CropFlashGeometry`: every decision
/// here is a function of the overlay bounds, so it lives out where it can be
/// tested without a screen. `HeartbeatDogFollow` reads `radius(in:)` to know
/// what the dog has to stand clear of, so the two sizes cannot drift apart.
