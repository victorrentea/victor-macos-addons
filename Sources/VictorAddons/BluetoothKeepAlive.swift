/// Keeps a Bluetooth speaker from dropping into power-save/standby between
/// sounds. Many BT speakers mute their amplifier after a few seconds of
/// silence, which clips the start of the next sound (a problem now that the
/// Mac renders the tablet-routed soundboard). While the *current default
/// output device* is one of those speakers we keep a **continuously looping**
/// near-silent tone (≈ -56 dBFS, inaudible in a room) playing, so the amp
/// never sees silence at all.
///
/// **Why continuous and not a burst every 30s** (2026-09-10): that is what the
/// first version did, and on the JBL Go 4 it stopped working — the amp mutes
/// after a few seconds, so 29.5 s out of every 30 were silence and each burst
/// only arrived to *re-wake* an already-muted amp, its own first moments
/// swallowed. The clipping it was supposed to remove came back. The whip
/// already knew this: `BluetoothOutput.startContinuousWarm()` exists precisely
/// because a periodic tone is not enough to play a crack with no spin-up lag.
/// The keep-alive now uses the same shape, with its own player so the whip
/// starting and stopping its warm never cuts ours.
///
/// Scope: only the active output, and only the speakers that actually need it
/// — the JBL boxes. Other Bluetooth outputs (e.g. "Vic Bose" headphones) don't
/// standby-mute, so pumping a tone into them is pointless. We check the default
/// output device's transport type *and* its name, and emit through the normal
/// default route (AVAudioPlayer), so nothing plays when the default output is
/// wired/built-in, the "🔊OS Output" loopback, or a non-JBL Bluetooth device.
/// No menu toggle — it self-gates on the name.
