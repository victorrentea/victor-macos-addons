/// 🐶 Pure geometry for the dog that keeps the 💓 heartbeat company. Everything
/// the dog has to decide is a function of the overlay bounds, its own box and one
/// point, so it lives out here where it can be tested without a screen — the same
/// bargain as `HeartbeatBump` and `CropFlashGeometry`.
///
/// **It used to be the exact opposite.** Until 2026-09-06 this file was
/// `HeartbeatDogFlee`: the dog bolted to the half of the screen the cursor was
/// not in. That joke stopped working once Victor started *zooming the room's
/// projector in on the beat* — the dog was then reliably in the half nobody was
/// looking at, i.e. off the projected frame entirely. So the rule inverted: the
/// dog is now **adjacent to the beat**, parked as close to the pulsing disc as it
/// can get without any of it sitting inside, with its **face** — not its centre —
/// as the thing held near the lens.
///
/// Three decisions, in the order they constrain each other:
///
/// 1. **Which side of the cursor.** The one with more room, with hysteresis on
///    the midline so a cursor parked on the seam doesn't make the dog oscillate.
/// 2. **How high.** Decided *before* the horizontal, because it is the pinned
///    one: the face rides at the cursor's own height, but the photo's bottom edge
///    is **never lifted off the floor of the screen** — it may go below, never
///    above (Victor, 2026-09-06). A beat low on the screen therefore leaves most
///    of the dog under the frame; a beat high on it does not lift the dog at all,
///    it just leaves the dog standing beneath the beat.
/// 3. **How far along that side.** Only as far as the ear needs to clear the
///    lens — and standing *below* the beat already pays part of that, so the
///    higher the beat, the closer in the dog tucks. If the frame will not give
///    the rest, the dog's *back* may hang off the outer edge up to
///    `maxBackOverflow`: a cropped rump is a cheaper failure than a face dragged
///    away from the beat.
///
/// Coordinates are the overlay's: bottom-origin, y growing upward.
