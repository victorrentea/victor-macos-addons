/// `main.swift` already implements a correct hand-over between instances: a new
/// process writes its pid to `/tmp/VictorAddons.pid`, SIGTERMs the old one,
/// SIGKILLs it if it does not go quietly, and the old instance also notices the
/// stolen lock file within 2s and leaves. That machinery has never been the
/// problem.
///
/// The problem is that **it almost never gets to run**. LaunchServices treats an
/// `open` of an already-running bundle as an *activation*, not a launch: no
/// second process starts, so nothing ever writes a new pid. Clicking "Victor
/// Addons" in Spotlight while it was wedged therefore did precisely nothing, and
/// the only way out was `pkill` in a terminal.
///
/// This closes that gap from the other side: the running instance turns the
/// reopen it *does* receive into a restart, and relaunches itself.
///
/// The relaunch is done by a **detached shell helper**, not by us, because the
/// one thing that must survive is the relaunch itself. The helper waits for our
/// pid to disappear and only then runs `open -n`, so it works identically
/// whether we exit cleanly, are SIGKILLed, or crash on the way out — and if we
/// somehow never die, it gives up after ~10s and launches anyway.
